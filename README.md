A simple Python script that monitors changes on a specified webpage by periodically comparing content checksums. If the content changes, the script alerts the user.

Features

    - Periodically checks a webpage for content updates.
    - Uses a rotating list of user-agent headers to mimic various browsers.
    - Alerts user when the content has changed.

Requirements

    - Python 3.x
    - requests library

Usage

    1. Set the URL to monitor in the script (url variable).
    2. Adjust sleeptime to define the time interval between checks (in seconds).
    3. Run the script

If the webpage content changes, the script will print "Changed" and stop. 
  ~Change to whatever you'd like

How It Works

    The script fetches the webpage content at intervals and computes a checksum using SHA-224.
    It compares the checksum to the previous one and prints "Not Changed" if content remains the same or "Changed" if it differs.
